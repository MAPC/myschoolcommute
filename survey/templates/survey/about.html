	<p>The <a href="" title="Metropolitan Area Planning Council">Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC)</a>, the regional planning agency for Metro Boston, 
		and <a href="http://www.walkboston.org/" title="WalkBoston">WalkBoston</a>, a nonprofit organization, have developed an innovative online survey tool 
		on how students get to and from school (mode choice). Data on student mode choice will provide schools with information they need to make decisions on 
		traffic and safety concerns, sidewalk infrastructure and connectivity, transportation, and school assignment policies. Furthermore, information on 
		mode choice can be used to plan safe and healthy walking options for students and can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions by shifting car trips 
		to and from school to walking or biking trips.</p>
	
	<p>During summer 2011, 20 schools in 7 districts utilized the travel to school online survey tool, resulting in over 600 surveys. Based on our initial survey results<sup>1</sup>,  
		we learned that car trips are the dominate mode of transportation with 55% of students in our sample being dropped off at school in the morning and 48% picked up 
		in the afternoon. Walking and taking the school bus were also common modes to school at 25% and 18%, respectively. These percentages were slightly higher 
		in the afternoon, with 29% of student walking from school and 20% taking the bus. We also looked at the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 
		shifting car trips to walking or biking trips. Six survey schools in four districts<sup>2</sup> emerged as having the best potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
		through walk to school initiatives, with potential reductions in emissions of more than 67,500 kgs per year, or 4% of all auto-commute related greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
		
	<p>The survey research and implementation was funded by the <a href="http://www.barrfoundation.org/" title="Barr Foundation">Barr Foundation</a> and fits squarely within its goals of promoting healthy habits of walking and biking for 
		elementary and middle school children and reducing carbon emissions. The results of our survey research will eventually lead to a targeted 
		<a href="http://www.saferoutesinfo.org/" title="Safe Routes to School"></a>Safe Routes to School (SRTS) program, representing new approaches to SRTS and mode shift programs, 
		potentially helping to set the stage for an effective and replicable national model. For more information on how your school can participate, please see below.</p>
	
	<h3>Survey Administration</h3>
	
	<p>This 3-minute, online survey can be easily administered to parents. Schools will be responsible for making parents aware of the online survey tool and providing them with 
		a link to the survey, which is available in 7 languages other than English. Parents will have a week or more, depending on the needs of the school, to complete the survey 
		before it closes and results are generated.</p>
		
	<h3>Survey Results</h3>
	
	<p>MAPC will provide a district/school level report, including a summary of the results accompanied by maps, tables, and charts. Although survey administration is free, 
		there is a fee to generate district and school level reports. For more information, please contact MAPC at <a href="mailto:admin@myschoolcommute.org?subject=MySchoolCommute.org Website Request">admin@myschoolcommute.org</a>.</p>

        <dd>These results are based on surveys submitted using our online tool and those submitted by paper, resulting in a sample of 4,446 surveys across 23 schools in 7 districts. 
        	We have suspended the use of the paper survey going forward due to the burden and cost of data entry.</dd>
